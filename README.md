# Airports Data Analysis Using MySQL

## This repository contains SQL scripts developed to perform various analyses on an airport dataset using MySQL. The tasks accomplished in these scripts include:

### 1. Counting Airport Entries:
Calculate the difference between the total number of airport entries and the number of distinct airport entries in the dataset.
### 2. Finding Airports with Shortest and Longest Names:
Query the two airports with the shortest and longest names, along with their respective name lengths (i.e., the number of characters). If there are multiple airports with the smallest or largest names, the one that comes first alphabetically is selected.
### 3. Querying Airport Names Starting with Vowels:
Generate a list of airport names that start with a vowel (A, E, I, O, U). The list is filtered to avoid duplicates.
### 4. Calculating Average Distance Between Airports:
Compute the average distance between all pairs of airports based on their latitude and longitude coordinates. The distance calculation involves computing the distance between each pair of airports and then averaging these distances.
